# `Backend` class reference

In most cases, you don't need to interact with backends directly, as they are used internally by `Queue`. For usual usage, see the [Queue reference](../queue.md) and [Getting Started](../../getting-started/index.md) guides to learn how to configure and use different backends.

If you need to implement a custom backend or want to understand how existing backends work, here's the reference information for the backend classes.

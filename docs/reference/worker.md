# `Worker` class reference

In most cases, you can run worker using CLI command `sheppy work`. See [CLI reference](cli.md#sheppy-work) for more details.

If you need to run it programmatically, you can use the `Worker` class.

```python
from sheppy import Worker

worker = Worker()
```

::: sheppy.Worker
    options:
        members:
            - work

::: sheppy.worker.WorkerStats
